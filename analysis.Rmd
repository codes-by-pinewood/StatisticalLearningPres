This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
file_path <- "communities.data"

# Read the .data file into a data frame
# Adjust parameters such as sep, header, and na.strings as needed

# Read the .data file into a data frame
data <- read.table(file_path, sep = ",", header = TRUE, na.strings = "?")

# Check the first few rows and the column names
head(data)
colnames(data)

```
```{r}
names_file <- "communities.names"
column_names <- readLines(names_file)

# Print the column names
#print(column_names)

csv_file <- "communities.csv"

# Write the data to a .csv file
write.csv(data, file = csv_file, row.names = FALSE)

# Confirm the .csv file has been created and written correctly
print(paste("CSV file saved to", csv_file))
```

```{r}
# Provided string with column names
# Extract lines that start with '@attribute'
attribute_lines <- grep("^@attribute", column_names, value = TRUE)

# Extract column names from the attribute lines
column_names <- gsub("^@attribute\\s+([a-zA-Z0-9_]+)\\s+.*$", "\\1", attribute_lines)

# Print the extracted column names
print(column_names)

```

```{r}
data_file <- "communities.data"

# Read the .data file into a data frame
data <- read.table(data_file, sep = ",", header = FALSE, na.strings = "?")

# Assign column names from the extracted list
colnames(data) <- column_names

# View the data to ensure the column names are correctly assigned
head(data)

# Read the .data file into a data frame
data <- read.table(data_file, sep = ",", header = FALSE, na.strings = "?")

# Assign column names from the extracted list
colnames(data) <- column_names

# View the data to ensure the column names are correctly assigned
head(data)
```
```{r}

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
